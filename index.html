            <h2>ABOUT KAT</h2>
            <p>
                Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could be.
                Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't all dressed to impress.
                Five years ago, she decided to open Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.
