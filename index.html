        <h2>About Kat</h2>
        <p>
          Kat is the ultimate cat lady you've always dreamed you could
          be. Never has a Halloween gone by where her twelve cats weren't
          all dressed to impress. Five years ago, she decided to open
          Kat's Costume Shop to share her passion with the world.
